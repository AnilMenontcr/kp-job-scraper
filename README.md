  location: "United States"
  max_companies: 100

rate_limiting:
  max_requests_per_hour: 50
  min_delay_seconds: 3
  max_delay_seconds: 8

output:

## 🔄 Manual Enrichment Workflow

1. **Generate Enrichment Template**
   - Run scraper to create `companies_to_validate.csv`
   - File includes Crunchbase search URLs

2. **Validate Companies**
   - Open each Crunchbase URL
   - Record: Revenue Range, Company Size, Funding Stage
   - Mark validation status as `COMPLETE` or `NOT_FOUND`

3. **Merge Validated Data**
   ```bash
   python src/merge_enrichment.py
   ```

4. **Review Final Output**
   - Check `job_leads_final_YYYYMMDD.csv`

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes per company (8-16 hours for 100 companies)

See [Enrichment SOP](docs/Enrichment_SOP.md) for detailed instructions.

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_rate_limiter.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test with small sample (5 jobs per role)
python src/main.py --max-companies 5

# Test specific role
python src/main.py --role "Data Scientist" --max-companies 10
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Rate Limited (429 Error)
**Symptoms:** Logs show "Rate limit detected"  
**Solution:** Increase `min_delay_seconds` to 5-10 in `config.yaml`

### Issue: Blocked (403 Error)
**Symptoms:** Logs show "Blocked (status 403)"  
**Solution:**
1. Add more user agents to `user_agent_rotator.py`
2. Increase delays between requests
3. Consider using Selenium with headless browser

### Issue: No Jobs Found
**Symptoms:** Scraper completes with 0 jobs  
**Solution:**
1. Manually visit Wellfound and verify job listings exist
2. Check if HTML structure changed (inspect page source)
3. Update CSS selectors in `wellfound_scraper.py`

### Issue: CSV Won't Open in Excel
**Symptoms:** Garbled characters or import errors  
**Solution:** Verify `encoding: "utf-8-sig"` in `config.yaml`

### Issue: Slow Execution
**Symptoms:** Takes >2 hours for 100 companies  
**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection speed
2. Reduce `max_delay_seconds` (but stay above 3s)
3. Verify no rate limiting occurring

For more help, see [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/Troubleshooting.md) or check logs in `logs/` directory.
